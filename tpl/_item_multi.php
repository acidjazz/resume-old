    Similar to EVB's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u02Mjxm_dqQ">Elf Yourself</a>; You would add the app on Facebook, go through a wizard interface picking a friend, a picture of them, cropping their face, adding some things they might say, and then it finally compiles a custom flash video.  Taking this one step further instead of just a flash link I compiled and uploaded the video to your facebook videos.  This allowed the video upload to also get on the wall and was viewable on tablets and phones.  To do this I used Adobe Flash on Windows instances w/ Auto IT to automate "File &gt; export &gt; Video" to produce the highest quality video from flash.  We went live w/ a farm of 4 Windows machines dedicated to this which had a turn around time of about 30 seconds.  It was also highly documented on how to scale in case traffic was to get even higher.  The campaign is over now but you can check a demo video <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZgmCzJfi2g">here</a> and a completed video <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Hpmb-SqsI">here</a>
